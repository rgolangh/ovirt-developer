## Synopsis
Ovirt-developer aims to lower the bar for getting started with developing for ovirt with focus on ovirt-engine. Using `docker-compose` a complete dev env should be ready, with an IDE, database, the project's git repo. It will make contribution much easier, New team members setup in zero time, and can act as the defacto live documentaion of getting an dev env up and running.

## Go, develop!
Installation:
```
$ sudo dnf install docker docker-compose
$ usermod -a -G docker [USER_NAME]

$ git clone https://github.com/rgolangh/ovirt-developer/
$ cd ovirt-developer
$ mkdir src db
$ chown 26.26 db
```

To get you started, simply spin the compsed docker up:
```
$ # share you xsession, run once
$ xhost +
$ docker-compose run developer
```

Clone ovirt engine:
```
# dirctory should be /home/ovirt/src
# if you want to push patches to gerrit, clone the repo with sshh + your username
$ git clone git+ssh://UESRNAME@gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-engine
```

Create engine user + database:
```                                                                   
  psql -h db postgres postgres <<EOF                                  
    create user engine password 'engine';                             
    create database engine owner engine template template0            
    encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';  
  EOF                                                                 
```

### What you get:
- 2 container, 1st is for the OS (Fedora 23) with ovirt-engine-jboss + jdk8 + git + mvn, 2nd is postgres.
- The source code is `src` dir on the host machine. Clone the ovirt-engine project to it from within or outside the container(it is a mounted volume so it persist).
- The db directory will be intialized by the postgres container and from there you can login to the db instance using ``` psql -h db postgres postgres #password is 'postgres' ```
- This give you enough flexibility to switch/upgrade components without problems (and also aligned with docker's principles)
- Intellij IDEA 15 community edition
  ```
  $ intellij &
  ```

## Motivation
TODO
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation
TODO-continue

The installation will pull and build few images on your machines, reuse your xsession socket, and mount your ovirt-engine git repository so every change made inside the container will be persisted out side of it. Alternatively this can be changed, we'll get that later.
So make sure you have few free Gb to for the images. Docker saves its images under /var/lib/docker. Personnaly I quickly ran out of space on / so my /var/lib/docker a symlink to /home/user/docker. Change it and restart docker service, your done.

I also had technical issues with the docker storage driver and switch to the overlay fs (recommended). Do that with:
  ```
  $ root@localhost cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
  $ root@localhost DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS=--storage-driver overlay
  ```

Initiate a `docker-compose up` command, it will build all containers and run them. Consecutive calls will run it wihout building (follow docker-compose docs).
